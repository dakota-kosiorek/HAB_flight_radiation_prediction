Dear Users,
Unfortunately, I do not have permission to distribute the all the source code that is part of CARI-7A, so a precompiled version is all I can freely distribute. 

Use of the BO'14 GCR model must be scripted, I never received source code to integrate and the executable from the developers for linux did not run on my distribution. The Windows DOS script should used as a guide. Hopefully you will have better luck.

During COVID-19 telework my access to linux is limited so development is a little behind the Windows version. The 2 features new in 4.1.1, 9x speed-up for flight doses and multiple-file analysis in command line, are not yet in the linux version. There are no changes to the calculations so results will be the same.

Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you.
