MENULESS OPERATION IS PRIMARILY CONTROLLED FROM "DEFAULT.INP" (see NOTES below).

NOTES:
0. DO NOT CHANGE THE FORMAT OF THIS FILE ABOVE "END"!!! EACH LINE IS A10,A2,A12 THROUGH END.
1. DIAGNOSE SETS INTERNAL DIAGNOSTIC PRINTING FOR ROUTINES NOT UNDER MANUAL CONTROL IN THE SOURCE CODE, SET TO  
   'YES' FOR MASSIVE OUTPUT IN FILES 'DIAGNOSE\CARI7CHK.DAT','DIAGNOSE\DIAGDAP.DAT',ETC. RUN TIMES WILL BE 
   INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. 
2. VEIWER EXPECTED COMMAND FORM IS 'VIEWER FILE_TO_OPEN', FOR LINUX/UNIX SYSTEMS './' IS NOT NEEDED SINCE
   OS RELATED CHANGES WILL HANDLE THAT SWITCH, BUT THE PROGRAM NAME COULD BE CASE SENSITIVE! ALSO, SELECTION
   IN VIEWER DESIGNATES WHICH PROGRAM IS CALLED FOR EDITING/VIEWING EXTERNAL FILES AT RUNTIME.
3. ONLY FILE WORKS RIGHT NOW, OUTPUT DIRECTLY TO THE SCREEN AND TO BOTH ARE NOT YET CODED! 
4. SELECTS THE OPERATING SYSTEM: WINDOWS/DOS OR OTHER (I.E., LINUX/UNIX). THIS CHANGES PATH IN SYSTEM CALLS,
   AS WELL AS ANY OS FILE MANIPULATION COMMANDS NOT AVAILBLE TO THE STD COMPILER. WINDOWS AND LINUX PATHS TO 
   FILES AND COMMANDS ARE ENCODED. SOME TWEAKING OF SOURCE CODE MAY BE NEEDED FOR OTHER OSes.
5. DISPLAY SELECTS THE USER INTERFACE: DOS (COMMAND PROMPT SHELL) OR GUI (NOT YET AVAILABLE)
6. TOGGLES INTERNAL MENUS. STARTING THE PROGRAM WITH THIS OPTION = 'NO!' WILL RESULT IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
   ANALYZE THE CONTENTS OF THE FILE NAMED AT LINE 5 IN DEFAULT.INP. IF THE FILE IS A .BIG OR .DEG FLIGHT DATA   
   FILE AND THE DATE = '0000/00/00', THEN DATES IN THE NAMED FLIGHT DATA FILE WILL BE USED, BUT OTHER RUN OPTIONS
   WILL BE CONTROLLED BY THE DEFAULT.INP AND CARI.INI CONTENTS. FOR LOCATION DATA FILES THE DATE AND OPTIONS IN  
   DEFAULT.INP ARE IGNORED, THE PROGRAM ALWAYS USES THE DATA IN THE NAMED FILE. FILENAMES ARE LIMITED TO LESS THAN 
   30 CHARACTERS. NORMAL OUTPUT FILES ARE PRODUCED: 
         FOR *.BIG OUTPUT WILL BE IN *.OUT
         FOR *.DEG A SUMMARY WILL BE IN *.SUM AND A LONGER REPORT IN *.DAT
         FOR A LOCATION FILE (SUGGEST *.LOC, OR *.TXT) THE OUTPUT WILL BE IN *.ANS (THE NAME OF THE LOCATION 
             DATA FILE CAN HAVE ANY 3-CHAR EXTENSION EXCEPT 'DEG' OR 'BIG'). 
   'FEW' WILL PROVIDE MENUS WITH A REDUCED SET OF OPTIONS TO BE LIKE CARI-6/6M. IT CHOOSES TOTAL EFFECTIVE DOSE FROM 
   ICRP PUB 103.          
7. SUPERPOS TOGGLES THE SUPERPOSITION APPROXIMATION FOR 'NO MENUS' USE FLIGHT ANALYSIS ONLY! IT HAS NO INFLUENCE 
   ON LOCATION FILE DATA ANALYSIS. 'NO' (RECOMMENDED AND DEFAULT) USES SHOWER DATA FOR ALL IONS (PROTONS THROUGH  
   IRON) IN CALCULATIONS. 'YES' FORCES THE CALCULATIONS TO USE THE SUPERPOSITION APPROXIMATION. IN THIS 
   APPROXIMATION ALL PRIMARY NUCLEI WITH MORE THAN ONE NUCLEON ARE APPROXIMATED AS Z FREE PROTONS AND N-Z FREE 
   NEUTRONS OF THE SAME ENERGY PER NUCLEON AFTER GEOMAGNETIC RIGIDITY CUTOFF FILTERING, (E.G. C-12 ENTERS 
   THE ATMOSPHERE AS 6 FREE PROTONS AND 6 FREE NEUTRONS).       
8. GCR_MODEL AFFECTS 'NO MENUS' USE FOR FLIGHT ANALYSIS ONLY. IT HAS NO INFLUENCE ON LOCATION FILE DATA ANALYSIS.
   IT SETS THE MODEL TO USE AS THE INPUT PRIMARY CR SPECTRUM. FOR THE TWO SPE SPECTRA (5 AND 6), PLEASE NOTE THAT 
   THE TWO SOLAR EVENT MODELS ARE TOTAL EVENT FLUENCE SPECTRA. 
   TO INPUT A CUSTOM SPECTRUM, SET GCR_MODEL = 7 AND PUT THE SPECTRUM DATA IN THE FILE GCR_MODELS\MY_MODEL.OUT. 
   IT MUST HAVE THE SAME FORMAT AS THE BO11_GCR.OUT FILE.
   EXPECTED UNITS ARE: nuclei/(m2-sr-s-GeV) FOR Z=1 to Z=26 (H THROUGH Fe) IONS. 
   *THE BO14 SPECTRUM NEEDS A CALLING SCRIPT APPROPRIATE TO THE OS AND SHELL. 'RUNBON14.BAT' IS SUPPLIED FOR 
   WINDOWS OS. ALSO, THE LINUX EXECUTABLE MAY NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH ANY PARTICULAR VERSION OF LINUX. CONTACT THE
   GCR MODEL DEVELOPERS TO REQUEST SOURCE CODE OR ALTERNATIVE EXECUTABLES FOR THIS MODEL.
   **THE SECOND ISO SPECTRUM (4) IS THE ISO LIS MODULATED USING CARI-6 HELIOCENTRIC POTENTIAL AT 1 AU.    
9. CHOOSE ISOTROPIC OR ANGULARLY RESOLVED TREATMENTS OF SHOWERS AND CUTOFF RIGIDITIES.     
   0 = 'None', MODEL USES ALTITUDE ADJUSTED APPARENT CUTOFF RIGIDITY CALCULATED FROM THE EFFECTIVE VERTICAL CUTOFF 
        RIGIDITY FOR ALL ANGLES OF APPROACH AND ASSUMES FLUX IS ISOTROPICALLY INCIDENT (RECOMMENDED AND DEFAULT). 
   1 = 'Locally-Adjusted Cutoffs', THE CELESTIAL SPHERE SURROUNDING THE VEHICLE AND UNBLOCKED BY THE EARTH
        (I.E., ABOVE THE HORIZON) IS DIVIDED INTO 900 SECTORS WHICH ARE ASSIGNED NONVERTICAL CUTOFF RIGIDITIES
        CALCULATED FROM SHEA&SMART EQUATIONS BASED ON LAT, LON, ZENITH, AZIMUTH, DATE, AND ALTITUDE. THE 
        FRACTION OF THE SHOWER ENTERING EACH SECTOR OF SKY IS ATTENUATED USING THE CALCULATED CUTOFF RIGIDITY. 
        (I.E., THE LOCAL CUTOFF RIGIDITY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CRAFT IS USED FOR INCIDENT GCR FLUX ENTERING 
        THAT SECTOR).        
   2 = 'Zenith-Dependent Transport', MODEL USES A SLANT FUNCTION TO TREAT ISO SHOWERS AS BEAMS WITH ZENITH
        DEPENDENT DEPTH. EFFECTIVE VERTICAL CUTOFF RIGIDITIES ARE USED FOR ALL ANGLES OF APPROACH.***
   3 = 'Transport and Cutoffs', RUN USING BOTH OPTION 1 AND 2.*** 
   4 = 'None', MODEL USES ALTITUDE ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE VERTICAL CUTOFF RIGIDITY FOR ALL ANGLES OF APPROACH AND 
   FLUX IS HANDLED AS ISOTROPICALLY INCIDENT
   ***NOTE OF CAUTION: THE ANGULARLY RESOLVED CUTOFFS ARE ACCURATELY CALCULATED, BUT THE SHOWER SECONDARY FLUENCES 
   WERE CALCULATED USING AN ISOTROPICALLY INCIDENT SOURCE AND THUS DO NOT LEND THEMSELVES WELL TO ANGULARLY RESOLVED 
   TREATMENTS (EVERYTHING HAS ALREADY BEEN AVERAGED OVER ANGLE IN THE TALLIES). ANGULARLY RESOLVED RESULTS WILL BE 
   MORE APPROXIMATE IN THAT SENSE THAN FOR THE COMPLETELY ISOTROPIC TREATMENT.  
10. VEHICLE TOGGLES USING OPTIONAL SHIELD DEFINITION DEFINED BY THE USER. THE USUAL (DEFAULT) PRACTICE IS TO ASSUME NO 
   SHIELDING OF OCCUPANTS BY THE VEHICLE. TO USE ALUMINUM AND POLYETHYLENE THICKNESSES DEFINED IN FILE 'VEHICLE.DAT'
   SET THIS TO 'YES'. 
11. THE CARI-7.RPT FILE HAS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME FORMAT AND NEW DATA WILL BE APPENDED TO IT JUST AS CARI-6.RPT WAS 
   FOR CARI-6 USERS. THIS ALLOWS THE AUTOMATED STORING IN A SINGLE FILE OF SEVERAL RUNS OF THE SAME FLIGHT PLANS USING 
   DIFFERENT DATES (E.G., FOR ROUTE DOSE STUDIES) AND EASES TRANSITION TO CARI-7 FROM CARI-6. SINCE THIS FILE WILL 
   CONTINUOUSLY GROW IF THIS SWITCH IS 'YES', CAUTION IN REGARDS TO READABILITY IS SUGGESTED.    
12. EXT_FINAL TOGGLES THE EXTENSION OF THE FINAL BINS IN THE PARTICLE SPECTRAL TO THIER EXTRAPOLATED TOTAL FLUXES
   ABOVE THE FLOOR ENERGIES OF THE BINS, BASED ON SPECTRAL INDICES AT HIGH ENERGIES. THIS DOES NOTHING TO SPE SPECTRA, 
   BECAUSE THEY ARE ALEADY FLAT AND EMPTY AT THE HIGHEST ENERGIES, BUT CAN ALTER RESULTS FOR GCR, WHERE THERE CAN BE 
   SIGNIFICANT FLUX OTHERWISE UNACCOUNTED FOR ABOVE THE TOP ENERGY OF THE HIGHEST ENERGY BIN. 'YES' IS RECOMMENDED.
13. FAST_FLT SPEEDS UP BIG FLIGHT EVALUATIONS BY REPLACING 1-MINUTE TIME STEPS WITH 9-MINUTE TIME STEPS WHEN POSSIBLE. 
   THIS CAN CAUSE A FEW PERCENT CHANGE IN THE FLIGHT DOSE ON SENSITIVE ROUTES.
