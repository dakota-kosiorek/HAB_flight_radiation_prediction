ONLY THE FIRST 5 LINES ARE READ. COMMENTS MAY BE PLACED AFTER LINE 5
Note: on some systems, as space is required before the middle three
entries (lines 2-4). Also, the first 4 lines are ignored if the file
on line 5 is a LOC style file and not BIG or DEG (flight data).

First item is a 10 character string for DATE: yyyy/mm/dd
   use 0000/00/00 to use dates from file
   for monthly average use dd = 00
   NOTE: include the zeros for months and days 
         (use 1998/04/01, do not use 1998/4/1)   

Second is integer HOUR
   for daily average use HOUR = 0, 
   This variable is ignored if dd = 00

Third is integer for PARTICLE
             CASE(0)        PARTICLE= TOTAL (see below)     
             CASE(1)        PARTICLE= NEUTRONS

             CASE(20)       PARTICLE= FLUORINE   
             CASE(21)       PARTICLE= NEON       
             CASE(22)       PARTICLE= SODIUM     
             CASE(23)       PARTICLE= MAGNESIUM  
             CASE(24)       PARTICLE= ALUMINUM   
             CASE(25)       PARTICLE= SILICON    
             CASE(26)       PARTICLE= PHOSPHORUS 
             CASE(27)       PARTICLE= SULPHUR    
             CASE(28)       PARTICLE= CHLORINE   
             CASE(29)       PARTICLE= ARGON

             CASE(32)       PARTICLE= SCANDIUM   
             CASE(33)       PARTICLE= TITANIUM   
             CASE(34)       PARTICLE= VANADIUM   
             CASE(35)       PARTICLE= CHROMIUM   
             CASE(36)       PARTICLE= MANGANESE  
             CASE(37)       PARTICLE= IRON       
             
Fourth item is integer TALLY
             CASE(1) secondary particle fluence (if particle 
                     is 'TOTAL', then output is total ion fluence,
                     which excludes neutrons and photons)            
             CASE(2) microSv, ICRP Pub. 103 EFFECTIVE DOSE 
             CASE(3) microSv, ICRP Pub. 60 EFFECTIVE DOSE  
             CASE(4) microSv, ICRU AMBIENT DOSE EQ. H(*10) 
             CASE(5) microGy, AVE WHOLE-BODY ABSORBED DOSE 
             CASE(6) microGy, Dose in 0.5 mm Si 
             CASE(7) microGy, Dose in 0.3 mm Si 
             CASE(8) Counts, Response rate NM64 neutron monitor BF-3 tube 
             [NM-64 NOT VALID if HZE and alpha flux is significant, i.e., Alt > 60kft]             

Fifth item is the name of the file to process: *.DEG or *.BIG or other.
             Name length must be less than 30 characters with no spaces and a 
             3-letter extension (e.g. EXAMPLE.BIG or MYPLACES.DAT):            
               if the extension is DEG then the program will process the flight file like CARI-6M, 
                    i.e., outputs will be in *.SUM (short form) and *.DAT (long form);
               if BIG then the program will process the flight file like CARI-6, 
                    i.e., output will be in *.OUT;
               otherwise the program processes the file as a locations definition file
                    i.e., output will be in *.ANS.
             If the file name is *.DEG or *.BIG, then all files of that kind in this folder/directory
                    will be used. This DOES NOT WORK for files in subfolders/subdirectories. 
             
Of course, bad data in any line could lead to either bad output or a crash, 
             e.g., the fourth line must not be 0, else calculated doses will be NaN.
