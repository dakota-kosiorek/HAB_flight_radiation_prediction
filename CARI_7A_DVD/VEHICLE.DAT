To use this file there must be a line in the variable list in CARI.INI that reads
VEHICLE   = YES
Reading this file must be indicated in CARI.INI or it will be ignored (NO! is the default). 
NOTE: This file allows the user to define structural shielding for the vehicle
1st line is Al alloy thickness in units of g/cm**2
2nd line is HDPE (polyethylene, i.e., CH2) thickness in units of g/cm**2
3rd line is added dry air thickness in units of g/cm**2, useful for testing.
The net effect is the thickness weighted average effect of the three shields.
